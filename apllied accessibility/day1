Alt text describes the content of the image and provides a text-alternative for it. This helps in cases where the image fails to load or can't be seen by a user. It's also used by search engines to understand what an image contains to include it in search results. Here's an example:
<img src="importantLogo.jpeg" alt="Company logo">
In situations when an image is already explained with text content,
or does not add meaning to a page, the img still needs an alt attribute,
but it can be set to an empty string. Here's an example:
<img src="visualDecoration.jpeg" alt="">

HTML5 introduced a number of new elements that give developers more options while also incorporating accessibility features. 
These tags include main, header, footer, nav, article, and section, among others.
By default, a browser renders these elements similarly to the humble div. However, using them where appropriate gives additional meaning in your markup. 
The tag name alone can indicate the type of information it contains, which adds semantic meaning to that content.
Assistive technologies can access this information to provide better page summary or navigation options to their users.

Main Tag-->
The main element is used to wrap (you guessed it) the main content, and there should be only one per page. 
It's meant to surround the information that's related to the central topic of your page.
It's not meant to include items that repeat across pages, like navigation links or banners.


<div> - groups content
<section> - groups related content
<article> - groups independent, self-contained content

header
It's used to wrap introductory information or navigation links for its parent tag and works well around content that's repeated at the top on multiple pages.

Note: The header is meant for use in the body tag of your HTML document. This is different than the head element, which contains the page's title, meta information, etc.

The nav element is another HTML5 item with the embedded landmark feature for easy screen reader navigation. 
This tag is meant to wrap around the main navigation links in your page.

the footer element has a built-in landmark feature that allows assistive devices to quickly navigate to it. 
It's primarily used to contain copyright information or links to related documents that usually sit at the bottom of a page.

***Â© to ge this symbol we use &copy
for audio we use audio tag
<audio id="meowClip" controls>
  <source src="audio/meow.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" />
  <source src="audio/meow.ogg" type="audio/ogg" />
</audio>
here controls disply start /puse button/mute /volume  on a audio  bar or strip

HTML5 introduced the figure element, along with the related figcaption. Used together, 
these items wrap a visual representation (like an image, diagram, or chart) along with its caption. 
This gives a two-fold accessibility boost by both semantically grouping related content, and providing a text alternative that explains the figure.
