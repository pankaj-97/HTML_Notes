Alt text describes the content of the image and provides a text-alternative for it. This helps in cases where the image fails to load or can't be seen by a user. It's also used by search engines to understand what an image contains to include it in search results. Here's an example:
<img src="importantLogo.jpeg" alt="Company logo">
In situations when an image is already explained with text content,
or does not add meaning to a page, the img still needs an alt attribute,
but it can be set to an empty string. Here's an example:
<img src="visualDecoration.jpeg" alt="">

HTML5 introduced a number of new elements that give developers more options while also incorporating accessibility features. 
These tags include main, header, footer, nav, article, and section, among others.
By default, a browser renders these elements similarly to the humble div. However, using them where appropriate gives additional meaning in your markup. 
The tag name alone can indicate the type of information it contains, which adds semantic meaning to that content.
Assistive technologies can access this information to provide better page summary or navigation options to their users.

Main Tag-->
The main element is used to wrap (you guessed it) the main content, and there should be only one per page. 
It's meant to surround the information that's related to the central topic of your page.
It's not meant to include items that repeat across pages, like navigation links or banners.


<div> - groups content
<section> - groups related content
<article> - groups independent, self-contained content

header
It's used to wrap introductory information or navigation links for its parent tag and works well around content that's repeated at the top on multiple pages.

Note: The header is meant for use in the body tag of your HTML document. This is different than the head element, which contains the page's title, meta information, etc.

The nav element is another HTML5 item with the embedded landmark feature for easy screen reader navigation. 
This tag is meant to wrap around the main navigation links in your page.

the footer element has a built-in landmark feature that allows assistive devices to quickly navigate to it. 
It's primarily used to contain copyright information or links to related documents that usually sit at the bottom of a page.

***Â© to ge this symbol we use &copy
for audio we use audio tag
<audio id="meowClip" controls>
  <source src="audio/meow.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" />
  <source src="audio/meow.ogg" type="audio/ogg" />
</audio>
here controls disply start /puse button/mute /volume  on a audio  bar or strip

HTML5 introduced the figure element, along with the related figcaption. Used together, 
these items wrap a visual representation (like an image, diagram, or chart) along with its caption. 
This gives a two-fold accessibility boost by both semantically grouping related content, and providing a text alternative that explains the figure.
<figure>
  <img src="roundhouseDestruction.jpeg" alt="Photo of Camper Cat executing a roundhouse kick">
  <br>
  <figcaption>
    Master Camper Cat demonstrates proper form of a roundhouse kick.
  </figcaption>
</figure>


Since radio buttons often come in a group where the user must choose one, there's a way to semantically show the choices are part of a set.
The fieldset tag surrounds the entire grouping of radio buttons to achieve this. It often uses a legend tag to provide a description for the grouping, 
which is read by screen readers for each choice in the fieldset element.
ex-->
form>
  <fieldset>
    <legend>Choose one of these three items:</legend>
    <input id="one" type="radio" name="items" value="one">
    <label for="one">Choice One</label><br>
    <input id="two" type="radio" name="items" value="two">
    <label for="two">Choice Two</label><br>
    <input id="three" type="radio" name="items" value="three">
    <label for="three">Choice Three</label>
  </fieldset>
</form>

there is a type called date in input gives a form in dd/mm/yy formate and allow user to pick the date .

Time Element --->
The time element along with a datetime attribute to standardize times. This is an inline element that can wrap a date or time on a page.
A valid format of that date is held by the datetime attribute. 
This is the value accessed by assistive devices. 
It helps avoid confusion by stating a standardized version of a time, even if it's written in an informal or colloquial manner in the text.

    we can use css property called --> just change the value of top and others things to move it out of the screen .
    and using over flow:hidden
    
    {
    The overflow property specifies what should happen if content overflows an element's box.
   This property specifies whether to clip content or to add scrollbars when an element's content is too big to fit in a specified area.4
   the overflow property only works for block elements with a specified height.
   
  # visible
The overflow is not clipped. It renders outside the element's box. This is default
#hidden
The overflow is clipped, and the rest of the content will be invisible

#scroll
The overflow is clipped, but a scroll-bar is added to see the rest of the content

#auto
If overflow is clipped, a scroll-bar should be added to see the rest of the content
#initial
Sets this property to its default value. Read about initial

#inherit
Inherits this property from its parent element


accesskey 
HTML offers the accesskey attribute to specify a shortcut key to activate or bring focus to an element. This can make navigation more efficient for keyboard-only users.
HTML5 allows this attribute to be used on any element, but it's particularly useful when it's used with interactive ones. This includes links, buttons, and form controls
.to acees the link directly with the key 
ex--><button accesskey="b">Important Button</button>

 p:focus {
    background-color: yellow;
  }
  
  use in corresspondence with tabindex
  tabindex=0-->default focus
  tabindex=1-->first focus on it . Similary two,three
  Note: A negative tabindex value (typically -1) indicates that an element is focusable, but is not reachable by the keyboard. 


    
    
    
    }
