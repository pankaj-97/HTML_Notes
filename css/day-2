in elements having different classes the class lower in css will override
id will overide all the classes and inline style elemnt will overide both class and id 
an elemnt can have only one class but can have more than one id 
In many situations, you will use CSS libraries. These may accidentally override your own CSS. 
So when you absolutely need to be sure that an element has specific CSS, you can use !important
  ex- color: red !important;
  
  HEx colors
  
  In CSS, we can use 6 hexadecimal digits to represent colors, 
  first two for the red (R), then  green (G), and last two for  blue (B) components. 
  hexdigist goes from (0-9) then (A,B,C,D,E)
   we can alo use 3 hexdigits with firstone for red,second for green ,third for blue.
   For example, #000000 is black and is also the lowest possible value. You can find more information about the RGB color system here.
   
 Another way you can represent colors in CSS is by using RGB values.
The RGB value for black looks like this:
rgb(0, 0, 0)
The RGB value for white looks like this:
rgb(255, 255, 255)
Instead of using six hexadecimal digits like you do with hex code, with RGB you specify the brightness of each color with a number between 0 and 255.
