label and button nd checkbox
 
 each of your radio buttons can be nested within its own label element. By wrapping an input element inside of a label element it will automatically
 associate the radio button input with the label element surrounding it.

All related radio buttons should have the same name attribute to create a radio button group. By creating a radio group, 
selecting any single radio button will automatically deselect the other buttons within the same 
group ensuring only one answer is provided by the user. ""
ex--
<label> 
  <input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor">Indoor 
</label>
         
VALUE

When a form gets submitted, the data is sent to the server and includes entries for the options selected. 
Inputs of type radio and checkbox report their values from the value attribute.
ex-->
<label for="indoor"> 
  <input id="indoor" value="indoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor">Indoor 
</label>

CHECKED
you can set a checkbox or radio button to be checked by default using the checked attribute.
To do this, just add the word "checked" to the inside of an input element. For example:
example--> set that option bt default
<input type="radio" name="test-name" checked>


At the top of your document, you need to tell the browser which version of HTML your page is using,
ou tell the browser this information by adding the <!DOCTYPE ...> tag on the first line, where the ... part is the version of HTML. 
For HTML5, you use <!DOCTYPE html>.
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <!-- Your HTML code goes here -->
</html>

Any markup with information about your page would go into the head tag. 
Then any markup with the content of the page (what displays for a user) would go into the body tag.
Metadata elements, such as link, meta, title, and style, typically go inside the head element.

"FORMAT"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <!-- metadata elements -->
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- page contents -->
  </body>
</html>
