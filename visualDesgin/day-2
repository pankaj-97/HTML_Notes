shadow there are two shadows

Text-shadow 
it has three  4 values x-axis,y-axis,blurr, color

x-axis--> postive right , negtice left
y-axis-->postive down , negative up
text-shadow:

Box shadow -->
The box-shadow property applies one or more shadows to an element.

The box-shadow property takes values for
offset-x (how far to push the shadow horizontally from the element),
offset-y (how far to push the shadow vertically from the element),
blur-radius,
spread-radius and
color, in that order.
The blur-radius and spread-radius values are optional.
Multiple box-shadows can be created by using commas to separate properties of each box-shadow element.
ex->box-shadow: 0 10px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.19), 0 6px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.23);

We can change the opacity of a text by using 
opacity where 
1:completly -opaque
0: completley tarnsparent 
and there can be value in-between
ex- opacity:0.7;

text-transform:uppercase  ;
it will transform the text without changing the text by typing
Value	Result
lowercase	"transform me"
uppercase	"TRANSFORM ME"
capitalize	"Transform Me"
initial	Use the default value
inherit	Use the text-transform value from the parent element
none	Default: Use the original text

font-weight property sets how thick or thin characters are in a section of text.
ex- font-weight-500(px is not used along with it)
