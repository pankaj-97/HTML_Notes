text alignment -->
text is often a large part of web content. CSS has several options 
for how to align it with the text-align property.
text-align: justify; causes all lines of text except the last line to meet the left and right edges of the line box.
text-align: center; centers the text
text-align: right; right-aligns the text
And text-align: left; (the default) left-aligns the text.

You can specify the width of an element using the width property in CSS.
img {
  width: 220px;
}
we can also adjust height-->
img {
  height: 20px;
}

strong tag is used for bold
ex--> <strong >Stanford University</strong>
 With the strong tag, the browser applies the CSS of font-weight: bold; 
 
underline text, you can use the u tag. This is often used to signify that a section of text is important, or something to remember. 
With the u tag, the browser applies the CSS of text-decoration: underline; to the element.
<u> hi</u>

To emphasize text, you can use the em tag. This displays text as italicized, 
as the browser applies the CSS of font-style: italic; to the element.
<em>hi</em>

To strikethrough text, which is when a horizontal line cuts across the characters, you can use the s tag. 
It shows that a section of text is no longer valid. With the s tag, 
the browser applies the CSS of text-decoration: line-through; to the element.
<s> hi</s>

You can use the hr tag to add a horizontal line across the width of its containing element.
This can be used to define a change in topic or to visually separate groups of content.

rgba stands for:
  r = red
  g = green
  b = blue
  a = alpha/level of opacity
The RGB values can range from 0 to 255. The alpha value can range from 1, 
which is fully opaque or a solid color, to 0, which is fully transparent or clear. 
rgba() is great to use in this case, as it allows you to adjust the opacity. This means you don't have to completely block out the background.
