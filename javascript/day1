We tell JavaScript to create or declare a variable by putting the keyword var in front of it, like so:
var ourName;

When JavaScript variables are declared, they have an initial value of undefined. 
If you do a mathematical operation on an undefined variable your result will be NaN which means "Not a Number".
If you concatenate a string with an undefined variable, you will get a literal string of "undefined".
